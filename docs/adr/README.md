# Architecture Decision Records (ADRs)

ADRs capture **why** we made important decisions so the project remains coherent over time.

Rules:

- Every non-trivial architectural decision gets an ADR.
- ADRs are immutable once “Accepted” (follow-ups get new ADRs that supersede older ones).
- Use the template: `docs/adr/template.md`.
